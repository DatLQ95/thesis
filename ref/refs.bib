abstract = {This forecast is part of the Cisco{\textregistered} Visual Networking Index™ (Cisco VNI™), an ongoing initiative to track and forecast the impact of visual networking applications. This document presents the details of the Cisco VNI global IP traffic forecast and the methodology behind it. For a more analytical look at the implications of the data presented in this paper, refer to the companion document The Zettabyte Era—Trends and Analysis or the VNI Forecast Highlights tool. Annual global IP traffic will surpass the zettabyte (ZB; 1000 exabytes [EB]) threshold in 2016, and will reach 2.3 ZB by 2020. Global IP traffic will reach 1.1 ZB per year or 88.7 EB (one billion gigabytes [GB]) per month in 2016. By 2020, global IP traffic will reach 2.3 ZB per year, or 194 EB per month. Global IP traffic will increase nearly threefold over the next 5 years, and will have increased nearly a hundredfold from 2005 to 2020. Overall, IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22 percent from 2015 to 2020.},

abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and the success of rich cloud services have pushed the horizon of a new computing paradigm, edge computing, which calls for processing the data at the edge of the network. Edge computing has the potential to address the concerns of response time requirement, battery life constraint, bandwidth cost saving, as well as data safety and privacy. In this paper, we introduce the definition of edge computing, followed by several case studies, ranging from cloud offloading to smart home and city, as well as collaborative edge to materialize the concept of edge computing. Finally, we present several challenges and opportunities in the field of edge computing, and hope this paper will gain attention from the community and inspire more research in this direction.},

@article{Kooti2016,
abstract = {Consumer spending accounts for a large fraction of economic footprint of modern countries. Increasingly, consumer activity is moving to the web, where digital receipts of online purchases provide valuable data sources detailing consumer behavior. We consider such data extracted from emails and combined with with consumers' demographic information, which we use to characterize, model, and predict purchasing behavior. We analyze such behavior of consumers in different age and gender groups, and find interesting, actionable patterns that can be used to improve ad targeting systems. For example, we found that the amount of money spent on online purchases grows sharply with age, peaking in the late 30s, while shoppers from wealthy areas tend to purchase more expensive items and buy them more frequently. Furthermore, we look at the influence of social connections on purchasing habits, as well as at the temporal dynamics of online shopping where we discovered daily and weekly behavioral patterns. Finally, we build a model to predict when shoppers are most likely to make a purchase and how much will they spend, showing improvement over baseline approaches. The presented results paint a clear picture of a modern online shopper, and allow better understanding of consumer behavior that can help improve marketing efforts and make shopping more pleasant and efficient experience for online customers.},

@article{Ullah2012,
abstract = {In terms of scalability, cost and ease of deployment, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach has emerged as a promising solution for video streaming applications. Its architecture enables end-hosts, called peers, to relay the video stream to each other. P2P systems are in fact networks of users who control peers. Thus, user behavior is crucial to the performance of these systems because it directly impacts the streaming flow. To understand user behavior, several measurement studies have been carried out over different video streaming systems. Each measurement analyzes a particular system focusing on specific metrics and presents insights. However, a single study based on a particular system and specific metrics is not sufficient to provide a complete model of user behavior considering all of its components and the impact of external factors on them. In this paper, we propose a comparison and a synthesis of these measurements. First of all, we review video streaming architectures, followed by a survey on the user behavior measurements in these architectures. Then, we gather insights revealed in these measurements and compare them for consensual and contrasting points. Finally, we extract components of user behavior, their external impacting factors and relationships among them. We also point out those aspects of user behavior which require further investigations. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Yu2006,
abstract = {Video-on-demand over IP (VOD) is one of the best-known examples of "next-generation" Internet applications cited as a goal by networking and multimedia researchers. Without empirical data, researchers have generally relied on simulated models to drive their design and developmental efforts. In this paper, we present one of the first measurement studies of a large VOD system, using data covering 219 days and more than 150,000 users in a VOD system deployed by China Telecom. Our study focuses on user behavior, content access patterns, and their implications on the design of multimedia streaming systems. Our results also show that when used to model the user-arrival rate, the traditional Poisson model is conservative and overestimates the probability of large arrival groups. We introduce a modified Poisson distribution that more accurately models our observations. We also observe a surprising result, that video session lengths has a weak inverse correlation with the video's popularity. Finally, we gain better understanding of the sources of video popularity through analysis of a number of internal and external factors.},

abstract = {The 5G Architecture Working Group as part of the 5G PPP Initiative is looking at capturing novel trends and key technological enablers for the realization of the 5G architecture. It also targets at presenting in a harmonized way the architectural concepts developed in various projects and initiatives (not limited to 5G PPP projects only) so as to provide a consolidated view on the technical directions for the architecture design in the 5G era. The first version of the white paper was released in July 2016, which captured novel trends and key technological enablers for the realization of the 5G architecture vision along with harmonized architectural concepts from 5G PPP Phase 1 projects and initiatives. Capitalizing on the architectural vision and framework set by the first version of the white paper, the Version 2.0 of the white paper was released in January 2018 and presented the latest findings and analyses of 5G PPP Phase I projects along with the concept evaluations. The work has continued with the 5G PPP Phase II and Phase III projects with special focus on understanding the requirements from vertical industries involved in the projects and then driving the required enhancements of the 5G Architecture able to meet their requirements. The results of the Working Group are now captured in this Version 3.0, which presents the consolidated European view on the architecture design.},
