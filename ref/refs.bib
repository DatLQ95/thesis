abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and the success of rich cloud services have pushed the horizon of a new computing paradigm, edge computing, which calls for processing the data at the edge of the network. Edge computing has the potential to address the concerns of response time requirement, battery life constraint, bandwidth cost saving, as well as data safety and privacy. In this paper, we introduce the definition of edge computing, followed by several case studies, ranging from cloud offloading to smart home and city, as well as collaborative edge to materialize the concept of edge computing. Finally, we present several challenges and opportunities in the field of edge computing, and hope this paper will gain attention from the community and inspire more research in this direction.},

abstract = {Consumer spending accounts for a large fraction of economic footprint of modern countries. Increasingly, consumer activity is moving to the web, where digital receipts of online purchases provide valuable data sources detailing consumer behavior. We consider such data extracted from emails and combined with with consumers' demographic information, which we use to characterize, model, and predict purchasing behavior. We analyze such behavior of consumers in different age and gender groups, and find interesting, actionable patterns that can be used to improve ad targeting systems. For example, we found that the amount of money spent on online purchases grows sharply with age, peaking in the late 30s, while shoppers from wealthy areas tend to purchase more expensive items and buy them more frequently. Furthermore, we look at the influence of social connections on purchasing habits, as well as at the temporal dynamics of online shopping where we discovered daily and weekly behavioral patterns. Finally, we build a model to predict when shoppers are most likely to make a purchase and how much will they spend, showing improvement over baseline approaches. The presented results paint a clear picture of a modern online shopper, and allow better understanding of consumer behavior that can help improve marketing efforts and make shopping more pleasant and efficient experience for online customers.},

@article{Ullah2012,
abstract = {In terms of scalability, cost and ease of deployment, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach has emerged as a promising solution for video streaming applications. Its architecture enables end-hosts, called peers, to relay the video stream to each other. P2P systems are in fact networks of users who control peers. Thus, user behavior is crucial to the performance of these systems because it directly impacts the streaming flow. To understand user behavior, several measurement studies have been carried out over different video streaming systems. Each measurement analyzes a particular system focusing on specific metrics and presents insights. However, a single study based on a particular system and specific metrics is not sufficient to provide a complete model of user behavior considering all of its components and the impact of external factors on them. In this paper, we propose a comparison and a synthesis of these measurements. First of all, we review video streaming architectures, followed by a survey on the user behavior measurements in these architectures. Then, we gather insights revealed in these measurements and compare them for consensual and contrasting points. Finally, we extract components of user behavior, their external impacting factors and relationships among them. We also point out those aspects of user behavior which require further investigations. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Video-on-demand over IP (VOD) is one of the best-known examples of "next-generation" Internet applications cited as a goal by networking and multimedia researchers. Without empirical data, researchers have generally relied on simulated models to drive their design and developmental efforts. In this paper, we present one of the first measurement studies of a large VOD system, using data covering 219 days and more than 150,000 users in a VOD system deployed by China Telecom. Our study focuses on user behavior, content access patterns, and their implications on the design of multimedia streaming systems. Our results also show that when used to model the user-arrival rate, the traditional Poisson model is conservative and overestimates the probability of large arrival groups. We introduce a modified Poisson distribution that more accurately models our observations. We also observe a surprising result, that video session lengths has a weak inverse correlation with the video's popularity. Finally, we gain better understanding of the sources of video popularity through analysis of a number of internal and external factors.},

Machine learning, a sub-domain of artificial intelligence, is highly suitable for complex system representation. In this tutorial paper, we review several machine learning concepts tailored to the optical networking industry and discuss algorithm choices, data and model management strategies, and integration into existing network control and management tools. We then describe four networking case studies in detail, covering predictive maintenance, virtual network topology management, capacity optimization, and optical spectral analysis.},

@article{Gu2020,
abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet and communication systems, both in the aspect of services and technologies, communication networks have been suffering increasing complexity. It is imperative to improve intelligence in communication networks, and several aspects have been incorporating with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The optical network, which plays an important role both in core and access network in communication networks, also faces great challenges of system complexity and the requirement of manual operations. To overcome the current limitations and address the issues of future optical networks, it is essential to deploy more intelligence capability to enable autonomous and flexible network operations. ML techniques are proved to have superiority on solving complex problems, and thus recently, ML techniques have been used for many optical network applications. In this paper, a detailed survey of existing applications of ML for intelligent optical networks is presented. The applications of ML are classified in terms of their use cases, which are categorised into optical network control and resource management, and optical network monitoring and survivability. These applications are analyzed and compared according to the used ML techniques. Besides, a tutorial for ML applications is provided from the aspects of the introduction of common ML algorithms, paradigms of ML, and motivations of applying ML. Lastly, challenges and possible solutions of ML application in intelligent optical networks are also discussed, which intends to inspire future innovations in leveraging ML to build intelligent optical networks.},

We present an actor-critic, model-free algorithm based on the deterministic policy gradient that can operate over continuous action spaces. Using the same learning algorithm, network architecture and hyper-parameters, our algorithm robustly solves more than 20 simulated physics tasks, including classic problems such as cartpole swing-up, dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion and car driving. Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives. We further demonstrate that for many of the tasks the algorithm can learn policies “end-to-end”: directly from raw pixel inputs.},
